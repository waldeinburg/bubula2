There's no directory listing, but here's the complete collection of cat
emoticons in the Unicode Standard:

<p style="font-size:5em">
  ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¹ðŸ˜ºðŸ˜»ðŸ˜¼ðŸ˜½ðŸ˜¾ðŸ˜¿ðŸ™€
</p>

If you're using [GNU FreeFont](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/freefont/) you will
notice that they violated the Unicode Standard regarding U+1F63D KISSING CAT
FACE _WITH CLOSED EYES_.

Also notice that the cat right to the kissing cat is U+1F63E POUTING CAT FACE
which has the note, "intended to depict pouting rather than simply anger". So
don't worry, the cat is not angry at you. It's just pouting. Pouting at the
fjords.
