𝔅𝔲𝔟𝔲𝔩𝔞² is a webcomic which … well, I do not yet know how it in itself should
be described, but I can say this:

𝔅𝔲𝔟𝔲𝔩𝔞² is called so for the simple – or not so simple it turned to become –
reason that I needed a name that reflected how I think about this comic and
ended up [being geeky about it](name).

I am a Danish, old school Christian, theologian and developer with
a predilection for the absurd. On the internet I go under the alias
_Waldeinburg_, so I do that here too (not that my name is a secret – it is
right there at the bottom of the page).

Hint: Pictures are uploaded with 800 pixels lengthwise as a compromise between
high quality and being able to show the whole picture on an average screen. For
upright pictures you can click the picture and toggle full screen (F11 on most
computers) to watch the whole picture on a screen with a height of 800 pixels.
