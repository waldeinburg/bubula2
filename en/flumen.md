I occasionally make doodles (especially during meetings at work) which I
like to share in a gallery. this gallery is
[𝔅𝔲𝔟𝔲𝔩𝔞² Flumen](http://flumen.bubula2.com). You can visit
[𝔅𝔲𝔟𝔲𝔩𝔞² Flumen](http://flumen.bubula2.com) _each Monday between
20 and 21 CET_.

Flumen is the new hip old school. Flumen is at the same time a website
and a return to all that was (or is, depending who you ask) charming or
annoying about flow TV and video rental services:

- The images are shown in randomized order, one image per page view;
  that is, only one person can watch each image. Your experience is
  unique for that week!
- Flumen is social: If other persons on the same network visits the site
  you will frequently block each other. Find that other person and visit
  the site together!
- The server is extremely primitively implemented. E.g., it will look as
  if the server is down if another is in the middle of a request. Reload
  the page if something's wrong; maybe it's just someone else standing
  in line in front of you!
- The site is only up and running one hour each week. It's running on an
  old
  [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) under my couch in a timer
  socket. The site may also be running if I choose to turn on the
  machine. And the site may be down if one of my kids has been playing
  under the couch.
