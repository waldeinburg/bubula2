The name 𝔅𝔲𝔟𝔲𝔩𝔞² is in itself pretty pointless, but I eventually ended up
having quite a few thoughts behind it. As such it is appropriate.

I prefer 𝔅𝔲𝔟𝔲𝔩𝔞 to be written with characters from the Unicode area U+1D504 -
U+1D537 (mathematical fraktur characters), that is, not "Bubula²" – however,
not everyone has [a font implementing those
glyphs](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/freefont/ "GNU FreeFont") (inside bubula2.com
there are no problems in most browsers because the site uses Web Fonts). From a
visual perspective 𝔅𝔲𝔟𝔲𝔩𝔞 og Bubula are the same words, but from a technical
perspective (that of the computer) they are not. The former is the sequence
(hexadecimal) 1D505, 1D532, 1D51F, 1D532, 1D529, 1D51E, while the latter is the
sequence 42, 75, 62, 75, 6C, 61.

If 𝔅𝔲𝔟𝔲𝔩𝔞 = 2 then 𝔅𝔲𝔟𝔲𝔩𝔞² is 2×𝔅𝔲𝔟𝔲𝔩𝔞, that is, the sentence: "Bubula bubula".
That is latin and means: "Hoot like an owl, beef" (beef being in the vocative).
The word "bubula" can be one of the following:

* **bubulo**, verb, "to hoot (like an owl)", present, active, imperative,
  singular. From _bubo_ (owl).
* **bubula**, noun, "beef", nominative, vocative or ablative. From the adjective below.
* **bubulus**, adjective, "ox-", nominative, vocative or ablative, feminine,
  singular, or nominative, vocative or accusative, neuter, plural. From _bos_
  (ox).

Therefore, if 𝔅𝔲𝔟𝔲𝔩𝔞 = 3 you get: "Bubula bubula bubula", which means: "Hoot
like an owl, ox-beef." But 𝔅𝔲𝔟𝔲𝔩𝔞 is 2, and that's final!

The verb _bubulo_ is a so-called _hapax legomenon_, that is, it only occurs
once in the known latin litterature. (Please note the all translations below
are my own and may be improved.) It is found in the poem, [_Elegia de Philomela
– et de aliarum avium, simul et quadrupedum,
vocibus_](http://books.google.dk/books?id=PnsvQbueMvAC&amp;pg=PA279#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)
("The elegy from the nightingales', and from the other birds', as well as the
lizards', voices") by [Albus Ovidius
Juventinus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventinus_Albius_Ovidius), verse 37.
Below is the word [in its
context](http://books.google.dk/books?id=PnsvQbueMvAC&amp;pg=PA284#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)
(my emphasis):

> _35_ Et cuculi cuculant et rauca cicada fritinnit,  
> _36_ Bombilat ore legens munera mellis apis.  
> _37_ **Bubulat** horrendum ferali carmine bubo,  
> _38_ Humano generi tristia fata ferens.

In English:

> _35_ And the cuckoos cuckoo, and the hoarse cicada chirps,  
> _36_ Hums with the mouth while collecting gifts of honey does the bee.  
> _37_ Hoots horrible with a funereal song does the owl,  
> _38_ As to the human race sad oracles it brings.

To complicate things it is theoretically possible that the word _bubulo_ does not exist at all. Below is a text critical note from the publication linked to above:

> \*Bubilat horrendum\* scribit Schottus, sed rectius est \*Bubulat\*, quod
> Ald. Bersm. et Gold. habent. Iidem scribunt \*ferali carmine bubo\*, quod
> expressum e Virgilio est, Æn. IV, 462. Schottus contra edidit \*ferali
> murmure\*.

In English:

> "Bubilat horrendum", writes Schottus, but the right is "Bubulat", as Ald.
> Bersm. and Gold. have. Likewise they write "ferali carmine bubo", which is
> taken from Virgil (Æn. IV, 462). Schottus, on the other hand, changes to
> "ferali murmure" (funereal mutter).

Well … enough of that.
