There's no directory listing, but here's the Unicode letter U+1F4A9 PILE
OF POO (yes, they actually decided that should be part of the Unicode
Standard):
    
<p style="font-size:5em">
  ðŸ’©
</p>
      
Oh, and they added the note, "may be depicted with a friendly face", so
depending on your font this character may make you happy.
